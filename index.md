 - to remotely connect to your account write the following into the terminal:
```
$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
 - replace the "zz" after "cs15lwi23" with your user id
P.S. my user is "ats"

## Step 4: Bash Commands

 - once inside try some bash commands
 - try ls (list)
 - try pwd (print working directory)
 - try cd ___ (change directory)
 - try ls / -Ral (lists all files in long format, this works recursively from root to all chilren)
 - press Ctrl + c to stop the printing
 - try exit to exit the remote access
